## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=33J0u0kxJ++6AXWqA++++setYHj
Your Rationale: The blue color pattern helps evoke a cool tone while also creating a sense of excitement! It helps the viewer see the focus area without blinding the user.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=32H1o1kx2s5aFw0g0qFqFg0w0aFk++hsaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aFkwi++bu++hX++++rd++kX
Your Rationale: This color pallet helps represent the colors of spring such as blue skies and green grass with brown for dirt.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=34b1q0kf+Qs4JZRaRVYkmJfol-M
Your Rationale: The colors in this pallet help evoke a sense of comfort where the colors arent super dark nor super bright!! They almost feel cozy.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13l050kCViwsMrHvomvM8dRUg8j
Your Rationale: This color pattern helps bring out a sense of old-school such as from early windows 98 color scheme / wallpaper background putting the user into that programming mindset.
