# Production Problem 10: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on a website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally, describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)

I would get rid of the double menu bar the web designer has implemented. Its simply obstructive because it confuses the user on which bar to actually use.
The pages can be accessed via drop down or clicking on the link. Instead, I would use it for recent updates / post updates etc. It is more handy
as a user does not have to scroll through the forums to see updates to recent posts!! To reomve the bar, the designer would have to remove the HTML
element from the index page and then modify the JS and CSS so the JS animations and actions are removed and the CSS is altered to fit the recent update element.
