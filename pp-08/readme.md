# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that object’s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: Luxury level car with deep black paint indicating luxury with a black sport exhaust. This resembles high quality and a fast car.

* Behavioral: comfortable to drive with all the technology and luxury provided while having a sport mode for spirited driving. 

* Reflective: Something i use everyday to get to places and love to keep clean and polished!

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. Visceral: Add/drop class should be easy and focused with the least amount of page hunting as possible from the user to get what they need done
2. Reflective: There should be as least as possible amount of redirects and links so that the user knows where and how everytime!
3. Behavioral: Simple elegenat design thats aesthically pleasing but being super simple so that mobile and desktop users can touch / click seamlessly
and operate easily.
