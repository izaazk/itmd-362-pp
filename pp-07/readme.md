# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook




2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:



* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742486(v=vs.85).aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I focused on flow for the first guideline on the login page. A user accesses the page and is greeted with a nice blurred
background with the IIT logo that pops out. This allows the users attention to flow easily to the IIT logo so the user knows the page they are browsing and then flows
smoothly to the login box as that is the object right underneath the logo. 



* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742468.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: The second part of the project, I focused on the idea of touch and control usage. I wanted to make the user feel
as if they have visited this site 100 times before. So we had decided to use a simple button layout for users to click between add / drop courses! It allows the user
to feel comfortable which creates a simpler enviornment.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn742463.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: We focused on percision so it allows the buttons to be easier to press and so it does not frustrate the user.
